    Being half way across the country makes planning a wedding a little tricky. Luckily, we have some awesome scouters who spent their days checking out great venues around Richmond. We gave them some words of how we wanted the site to &ldquo;feel&rdquo; (playful, organic, cozy, honoring of us/guestsâ€¦) that they could base their opinions off of. After they visited Tuckahoe Plantation we heard endless praises about the feel of the place. Our <%= link_to "planner", "http://www.lovebirdsevents.com/", :target => :_blank %> and <%= link_to "photographer", "http://rachel-may.com/", :target => :_blank %> expressed their love of the venue as well, both calling it one of their all-time favorite places for weddings.

    Only 7 miles from the city, right along the river, miles and miles of rolling hills&hellip; it sounds just right for what we are hoping for. Although we won&rsquo;t see it in person until this summer, we already feel that there could be no better place to celebrate this special day.

        In 2008, while on veritably the greatest freshman hall in Carnegie Mellon's history, Eli met Matt Katase and Asa Foster. Following graduation, Matt and Asa dedicated their days to opening their own craft brewery in Pittsburgh, PA, and we're lucky enough to have The Brew Gentlemen serving their finest brews at the wedding reception.
