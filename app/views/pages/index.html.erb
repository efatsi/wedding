      I&rsquo;m Kelsey. I like colors (a lot) and any and all kinds of art. Exploring Boulder with my awesome fiancé and sweet sweet pup Bodhi is one of my favorite things to do. Brown sugar, flowers, maté, and candles are pretty awesome things. Right now I&rsquo;m working toward my Master&rsquo;s in Art Therapy, teaching classes part time at Tinker Art Studio, and loving everything about what I&rsquo;m doing. Life is pretty darn good, especially with mister Elias :)

  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <p>
    Hmm..what to say? We met freshman year of high school in Richmond, Virginia (link). Although we socialized in different circles (read: high school cliques are ridiculous), Kelsey was intrigued by Eli&rsquo;s “disregard for the rules” and Eli always thought Kelsey was the prettiest girl in school. We went our separate ways in college, one moving South to Miami and the other moving North to Carnegie Mellon.
  </p>

  <p>
    After graduating in 2012, both made their way to the most wonderful town - Boulder, CO. Being the first to make the move West, Eli reached out via good ole Facebook to offer up his Boulder knowledge for Kelsey&rsquo;s culture shock. Kelsey, in New Hampshire at the time celebrating graduation with friends, got butterflies of excitement (as her bridesmaid, Raphi, can attest) and spent a good amount of time and energy concocting the FB message response.
  </p>

  <p>
    They arranged a meet up over beer due to Eli&rsquo;s confusion over why people like the taste of coffee. That summer, Eli got Kelsey hooked on hiking, camping, bicycle repairs, and drinking good beer; and Kelsey introduced Eli to a suitcase full of art supplies, the coolest dog ever, and regular teeth brushing habits. From there, it&rsquo;s history!
  </p>

  <h2>The Proposal</h2>

  <p>
    We went out to SALT, a great restaurant on Pearl just a few blocks from our house for a surprise date night. On the walk home, Eli offered Kelsey some homemade chapstick*. While pulling the chapstick from his pocket, he happened to drop it - a thoroughly practice maneuver. Fearing the chapstick container might have been damaged, he knelt down to make sure everything was okay. When Kelsey, now also concerned, turned around to check on things, Eli happened to be on one knee and the chapstick container happened to be holding a new ring for Kelsey&rsquo;s left hand. She was ecstatic, burst out a &ldquo;YES&rdquo; and they laughed, cried (tears of joy), and commenced celebrating.
  </p>

  <p class="cliffnote">
    * Kelsey made chapstick for Eli as a Christmas present (the flat cylinder kind, not the stick tube kind). Given the dry climate of Colorado, it&rsquo;s always good to have this chapstick on hand.
